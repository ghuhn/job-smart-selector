3. Names should be 2-4 words maximum and contain only letters, spaces, apostrophes, or hyphens
4. If you see patterns like "John_Doe_Resume.pdf", "Resume_2024_Final", "resume.pdf" - these are NOT names
5. Extract information semantically, not based on section headers
6. Email addresses MUST follow xxx@xxx.xxx format - be very strict about this
